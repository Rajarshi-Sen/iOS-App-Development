Work with Property List and pulling data off web:

Create a property list (plist) containing information about seven of the founding fathers of the United States.  
You will then read data from the plist and display the names and political party of the seven founding fathers.

Create a new single view application (for iPhone) named, YourName-FoundingFathers, where YourName is the first letting of your first name,
followed by your last name. For example, KWergesFoundingFathers.

Create a property list to store the information indicated in the table below. Within your project, create a plist: 
File / New / New File
Under iOS, click on Resources and select Property List. Name your file FoundingFathers in your project folder.

You will need to find the image file for each of the seven founding fathers and assign the same image name that you indicated in the plist.
